## 1) Download and open the TextToQuestionBankGuiConverter.exe file on your Windows computer. 

To download the program, click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JaredTweed/TextToQuestionBankConverter/main/BetaVersion/TextToQuestionBankConverter.exe).  

## 2) Format your multiple-choice questions
Format them consistent with the following examples. Leave a blank line between questions. Mark the correct answer with an asterisk:  

```

Parkinson's law  
The Peter Principle  
*Belief bias  

Which of the following is explicitly making a claim about cause?  
*If you learn to manage your stress, that will make you more likely to get promoted to a management position  
People who supervise more people at work tend to have lower levels of stress  
People who exercise regularly tend to have fewer medical problems  
```
## 3) Type in a title for your quiz 
Write this in the "Quiz Name" space in the top left of the conversion program 

## 4) Input your questions by doing one of the following:
Note that the questions with errors will be highlighted in red.  
\- Type or paste your test questions into the big textbox on the left side of the screen.  

\- Or instead, write your test questions in your word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word). Afterwards, save your word processor file as a textfile on your computer, and then click the "Open Textfile" option at the bottom left of the conversion program to select that saved file from your default file manager application.

## 5) Click on "Create Question Bank" 
\- Found near the bottom of the conversion program window.  
\- You will be asked by using the file manager application to select where you want to save the output file.  
\- You will now have a Question Bank file (a .zip file) that can be imported to Blackboard or Moodle. If you are importing the test questions into Moodle, specify that your file is in Blackboard format.

The testbank will be in Blackboard format, so you may need to select that option when you import it into Moodle (or whichever Learning Management System you use).  

## Font size: 
To change the font size displayed in the conversion program press a digit key (1 through 9) while holding the Ctrl key on your keyboard.
