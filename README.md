## 4) Input your questions by doing one of the following:
Note that the questions with errors will be highlighted in red.  

Type or paste your test questions into the big textbox on the left side of the screen. Or instead, write your test questions in your word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word). Afterwards, save your word processor file as a textfile on your computer, and then click the "Open Textfile" option at the bottom left of the conversion program to select that saved file from your default file manager application.

## 5) Click on "Create Question Bank" 
\- Found near the bottom of the conversion program window.

\- You will now have a Question Bank file (a .zip file) that can be imported to Blackboard or Moodle. If you are importing the test questions into Moodle, specify that your file is in Blackboard format.

The testbank will be in Blackboard format, so you may need to select that option when you import it into Moodle (or whichever Learning Management System you use).
